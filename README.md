# FaultyCalculator-using-JS
this is a faulty calculator i created using java script it gives perfect output 90% of the time but there is a 10% chance that is produces wrong output 
ive only used JS here but to make it more useful we can simply add an index.html file and replace all the console.log statement with alerts or and use prompt statement
